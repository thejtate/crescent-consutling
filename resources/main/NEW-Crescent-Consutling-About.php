             In 2006 Colley Andrews, Ken Davidson and Darvin Knapp founded Crescent Consulting, LLC and Crescent
             Services,
             LLC collectively known as Crescent Companies, LLC. The companies are headquartered in Oklahoma City. With
             over
             100 years of combined experience in the oil and gas industry, the founders set out to establish a service
             company focusing on water management solutions for operators and a consulting company to provide the
             industry
             with talented, experienced well site supervisors.
           </p>

           <p>
             Crescent Consulting provides well site consulting to their clients and project management for drilling,
             completions and work-overs. “We can provide a well plan and execute it for the client, from project
             management
             to production, Andrews says. “We can execute a task as complex as a well plan and have numerous experienced
             consultants available to supervise drilling operations,” he adds. The consulting business was established
             out
             of a desire to fulfill an industry need, “Our experience in the drilling and completion business has opened
             us
             up to a network of experienced individuals over the years,” explains Andrews. “We turned that network into a
             consulting company that provides the best consultants in the industry” says Andrews.
